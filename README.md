# ParticleSystem
My first implementation of particle system in c++. It deliveres an interface for creating animations
that use particle system.

In "animation" folder there's sample code that generate water which can collide with sphere 3D object
and fireworks. To run this code you will need openFrameworks tools.

My goal for the future is to make very flexible yet simple interface for making 3D animations with particle 
system.
