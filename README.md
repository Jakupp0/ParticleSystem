# ParticleSystem
My first implementation of particle system in c++ made for labs.
It deliveres an interface for creating animations
that use particle system.

In "animation" folder there's sample code that generate water which can collide with sphere 3D object
and fireworks. To run this code you will need openFrameworks tools.
